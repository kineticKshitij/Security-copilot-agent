## Security Principles

### Core Security Tenets

#### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All network communications and access requests are authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and services receive minimum necessary permissions
- **Continuous Validation**: Real-time verification of security posture and access decisions

#### 2. Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: Redundant security controls at network, application, and data levels
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configurations with explicit allow lists
- **Compartmentalization**: Isolation of critical components and data

#### 3. Privacy by Design
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and process only necessary security data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for intended security purposes
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about data collection and usage

#### 4. Continuous Security
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
- **Automated Response**: Immediate response to security threats
- **Regular Assessment**: Periodic security reviews and updates

## Threat Model

### Threat Actors

#### External Threats
- **Cybercriminals**: Financially motivated attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities
- **Nation-State Actors**: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) targeting infrastructure
- **Hacktivists**: Ideologically motivated groups targeting organizations
- **Script Kiddies**: Inexperienced attackers using automated tools

#### Internal Threats
- **Malicious Insiders**: Employees with authorized access acting maliciously
- **Negligent Users**: Unintentional security violations due to lack of awareness
- **Compromised Accounts**: Legitimate accounts controlled by external actors
- **Third-Party Vendors**: External partners with system access

### Attack Vectors

#### Network-Based Attacks
